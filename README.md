# Titanic_Survival
Different parameters relating to the rate of survival of passengers in the 'Titanic' tragedy.

Titanic data set is a interesting data set, which gives the insights about the tragedy happened with the titanic voyage.
We here will compare the variables with the rate of survival by getting the relation between them about how the survival rate is affected.
Steps-
a)Get the data.
b)Split the data set into training and testing data.
c)Compare the variables by plotting them against the dependent variable 'Survived', which we are going to predict here.
d)Impute the missing values for the columns which contains NAs.
e)Train a regression model on the training data, predict it on the testing data for its validation.
f)Get the accuracy for the model.

Technique used - ML, Regression, validation, Visualization, Data wrangling.
Libraries used - broom, caret, dplyr, pRoc.
